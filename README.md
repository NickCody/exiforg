# exiforg

_An tiny organizational tool for media files_

Supports Adobe DNG, MTS, and M4V files

Will move files into dated directory and touch files with datetime contained in the underlying EXIF data.
Will not overwrite original filename during move, but will append datetimestamp
If filename with appended datetimestamp is encountered, it will be overwritten. The assumption here is that the file should be the same. 

Use at your own risk!
